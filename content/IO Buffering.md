*I/O Buffering* is the time overhead that IO systems use to perform *input* operations before a request has been made and a *output* after a request has been made.

### Why we need buffering?
*Buffering* is a technique that soothes out  peaks in I/O Demand. Keep in mind that no amount of buffering can make an I/O device as fast as a process. The main advantage of buffering is to increase efficiency of the OS and performance of individual processes.
