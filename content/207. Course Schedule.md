## Question

## Approach 
The approach to this problem would be understanding how the pre-requisites work. 
We use [[DFS for Graphs]] to check if every course's pre-requisites are satisfied. 

Difficulty I had: building the adjacency list and properly executing [[DFS for Graphs]].
## Solution 
``` python
Â def canFinish(self, numCourses: int, prerequisites: List[List[int]]) -> bool:
	#first build an adjacency list for num courses
	#key: course number, value: empty list

	adjacency = {x: [] for x in range(numCourses)}
	
	for pre, crs in prerequisites:

		adjacency[pre].append(crs)
	
	#this will keep track of the vertices that we are going to visit
	visited = set() 

	#nested DFS function
	def dfs(v):
		if v in visited:
			#already visited, return false
			return False
			
		if adjacency[v] == []:
			#empty adjacency, return true
			return True

		visited.add(v) #we are visiting vertex v
		
		for pre in adjacency[v]:
			if not dfs(pre):
				#prereq cannot be satisifed, return False
				return False
		#remove current vertex from visited to not triger if statement
		visited.remove(v)
		#set adjacency to [] as all prereqs for current course has been satisfied
		adjacency[v] = []
		return True
		
	#we call DFS on every course to account for disconnected graphs
	for i in range(numCourses):
		if not dfs(i):
			return False
			
	#all courses have been satisfied, so return true
	return True
```
