## Problem 

![[Pasted image 20240213155212.png]]

## Approach 
As we want to check if the children are balanced, we have to go bottom-up. This means that we need to do a [[Post-Order Traversal]]. 

## Implementation 

```python 
def isBalanced(self, root: Optional[TreeNode]) -> bool:

	def DFS(node):
		#base case 
		if not node:
			return [True, 0]

		#post-order traversal
		leftHeight = DFS(node.left)
		rightHeight = DFS(node.right)

		#checking if current node is balanced 
		balanced = leftHeight[0] and rightHeight[0] and  abs(leftHeight[1] - rightHeight[1]) <=1
		#getting new height -> max of left and right + 1 
		return [balanced, 1 + max(leftHeight[0], rightHeight[0])]
	
	#calling DFS on root 
	return DFS(root)[0]
```
