Two main approaches instead of using [[Breadth First Search for Undirected Graph]] and [[Depth First Search for Undirected Graph]] through every single node

### Hill Climbing Algorithm 
- Start at a random node 
- Calculate fitness value of all neighbors 
- Move to neighbor with best fitness algorithm 
### Genetic Algorithm 
Emulates *natural evolution* with the following process
- Create an initial population of random chromosomes 
- *Select* fit individuals for reproduction 
- *Generate* new population through reproduction of selected 
- Continue doing so until an optimal solution
