- Program $P$
- Modified version $P'$
- Test set $T$

Using $T$, we find a way to gain sufficient confidence in the correctness of $P'$

### Steps 
1. Identify the modification made to $P$ 
2. Select a subset $T' \subseteq T$
3. Retest $P'$ with $T'$ and establish correctness 

Step $2$ involves the [[Test Case Selection]]
