Similar to [[Undirected Graph]] but all edges are *directed* pairs $(v, w)$
- edges are also called *arcs*
- $v$ is the *source node*, $w$ is the *target*

 DAG is a *directed graph* with no cycle

The *in-degree* of $v$ is the number of edges of the form $(u, v)$
The *out-degree* of $v$ is the number of edges of the form $(v, w)$
