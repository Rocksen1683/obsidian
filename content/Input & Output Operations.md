Three main types: 
- **Programmed I/O** - I/O device executes instructions but does not send an interrupt. Processor has to keep checking for status and this takes away a lot of the time
- **Interrupt-driven I/O** - Processor does other work while I/O device is doing a task. I/O device interrupts processor after it's done
