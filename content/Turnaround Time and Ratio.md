*Turnaround Time* is defined as the amount of total time that the process has spent in the system (including waiting). It is denoted by $T_{r}$. 

$T_{r} = w + s$


*Turnaround Ratio* is defined as the ratio between *turnaround time* and the total system time . This is also called the *normalized residence ratio* and basically tells us how much delay there is between turnaround time and system time.
$$T= \frac{T_{r}}{s}$$
