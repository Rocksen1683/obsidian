The *long-term scheduler* is responsible to decide which processes are admitted into the system for processing. Therefore the *long-term scheduler* decides the *degree* of multiprogramming as based on the number of processes, the multiprocessor has to decide how much multiprogramming it should have. 

The *long-term scheduler* might be invoked if the processor is idle for a long time beyond a certain threshold, in which case we want to let in new processes.
