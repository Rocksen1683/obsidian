To help with the process of relocation in partitioning, we define the following types of addresses 
- **Logical Address:** reference to a memory location relative to the starting address (does not correspond to a physical address in memory)
- **Relative Address:** the address is expressed as a location relative to some known point 
- **Physical Address:** is an absolute address in main memory
