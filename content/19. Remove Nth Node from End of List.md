## Problem 
https://leetcode.com/problems/remove-nth-node-from-end-of-list/

## Approach 
- Use dummy node and set it's next to head 
- 2 pointers -> slow set to dummy, fast set to head 
- Move fast by **n** nodes to get gap of $n+1$
- While fast, move both pointers till the end 
- Now we are at the node behind the node we want to delete 
- Delete by setting node's next to node's next next 

## Solution 
```python 
 def removeNthFromEnd(self, head: Optional[ListNode], n: int) -> Optional[ListNode]:
#get two pointers to be at a difference of n + 1 because we want slow to be behind element to be deleted
	dummy = ListNode(0)
	dummy.next = head
	slow = dummy
	fast = head

	#move fast to difference of n + 1 -> slow at dummy, fast at head
	for i in range(n):
		fast = fast.next
		
	#move both pointers till the end  
	while fast:
		fast = fast.next
		slow = slow.next
		
	#delete slow
	slow.next = slow.next.next
	
	return dummy.next
```
