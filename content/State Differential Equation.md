The *state differential equation* relates the rate of change of the state of the system ($\dot{x}$) to the state of the system ($x$) and the input signals ($u$)

Given a particular *state vector*:

$$x = \begin{bmatrix} x_{1}(t) \\ x_{2(t)} \\ ... \\ x_{n}(t) \end{bmatrix}$$
and a vector of *input signals* $u(t)$, the state differential equation would be 

$$\dot{x}(t) = Ax(t) +Bu(t)$$
