## Question 
https://leetcode.com/problems/merge-intervals/description/
## Approach 
- Sort based on start times of intervals 
- Add first one to output 
- Iterate through rest and check if next has start < prev finish 
	- If so merge 
- else just add 
## Solution 
```python 
def merge(self, intervals: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:
	#first sort by start values
	intervals.sort(key = lambda i : i[0])

	merged = []
	#add first value to output
	merged.append(intervals[0])


	#iterating through rest
	for start, end in intervals[1:]:
		#if prev finish greater than start -> merge
		if merged[-1][1] >= start:
			merged[-1][1] = max(merged[-1][1], end)
		#no need to merge
		else:
			merged.append([start, end])

	return merged
```
