The processor issues an I/O command on behalf of a process. There are then two possibilities. If the I/O instruction from the process is nonblocking, then the processor continues to execute instructions from the process that issued the I/O command. If the I/O instruction is blocking, then the next instruction that the processor executes is from the OS, which will put the current process in a blocked state and schedule another process.
