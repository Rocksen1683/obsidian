***Block Oriented*** I/O devices are devices that transfer information in *blocks* of fixed size. Transfers are made one block at a time and data is referenced by block number 
Examples - Disks and USB keys (anything with secondary storage tbh)

***Stream Oriented*** I/O devices are devices that transfer information as a *stream* of bytes with *no fixed* structure. 
Examples - Terminals, printers, mouse, etc. (non-storage devices basically)
