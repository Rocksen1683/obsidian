## Intro 

Hi, I'm Ekanshh and I'm a third-year Software Engineering student at the University of Waterloo. My program at university is a mix of applied computer engineering and more theoretical computer science which means i take courses like graph theory, algo, OS, but also digital circuits, signals and systems etc. This diversity has enabled me to tackle a wide variety of technical challenges -> 3 internships, projects, hackathons 

- SEW Eurodrive -> Perception and mapping algos for autonomous forklift 
- Sagen -> Big Data microservice and ML for insurance 
- RBC -> Data Pipelines for a database 

but also what I love about tech is that it's a constantly growing field and keeps you on your feet but also it's a way that I feel I can express myself in terms of building things that would genuinely impact people's lives in a positive way. keep doing what i want to do at Microsoft 


## Questions 
- What kind of projects have interns on your team done in the past?
- Would I be working in your team?
- From a technical standpoint, how does a Microsoft internship differ from other ones 
- Microsoft is very collaboration heavy -> but what exactly will i be collaborating
