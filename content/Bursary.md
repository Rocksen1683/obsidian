Essay 1 
I am applying for the International Undergraduate Full-time bursary to help alleviate the significant financial challenges my family and I are currently facing. Three months ago, my father, who was employed as a Test Manager at HCL Technologies, was unexpectedly laid off. This has resulted in a substantial reduction in our household income, creating additional financial strain on our family. The sudden loss of his income has meant that I have had to contribute more towards my tuition fees than I had initially planned, stretching my finances beyond what I can afford.

Additionally, my family is currently supporting my younger sister's education, which further intensifies our financial burden. With my father's job loss, the responsibility of covering educational expenses for both my sister and myself has become significantly more challenging. My parents are doing their best to support us, but the financial strain is immense, especially in these uncertain times.

Furthermore, I recently faced an unexpected expense when my laptop, a crucial tool for my studies, broke down. I had to purchase a new one to ensure I could continue my education without disruption, which added another layer of financial pressure. This unforeseen cost has further strained my limited resources, making it even more difficult to manage my academic expenses.

Given these circumstances, receiving this bursary would greatly assist in easing the financial burden on my family and allow me to focus more on my studies without the constant worry about our financial situation. I am committed to my education and am striving to succeed academically, and this support would be invaluable in helping me achieve my goals during this challenging period.


q2:
My financial situation has become increasingly challenging due to a series of unforeseen circumstances that have significantly impacted my family’s income. Three months ago, my father, who worked as a Test Manager at HCL Technologies, was laid off. This sudden job loss resulted in a dramatic reduction in our household income, which has had a profound impact on our ability to manage educational and daily expenses. As a result, I have found myself contributing more toward my tuition fees than I had initially anticipated, stretching my financial resources to the limit.

In addition to this, my parents are currently supporting both my education and that of my younger sister. With the loss of my father’s income, covering the educational expenses for both of us has placed a considerable financial strain on my family. Despite their best efforts to manage, the dual responsibility of supporting two children’s education has made it extremely difficult to make ends meet.

Compounding these challenges, I recently encountered an unexpected expense when my laptop, an essential tool for my academic work, broke down. I had to replace it promptly to ensure continuity in my studies, which further strained my already limited finances. This unexpected cost has added to the financial pressure we are facing, making it even harder to manage our academic expenses.

Although I did not apply for student aid initially, it was because I was unaware of the full extent of the financial difficulties we would encounter following my father’s job loss and the additional expenses that would arise. Now, recognizing the pressing need for financial support, I am seeking assistance through this bursary to help alleviate some of the financial burdens on my family. This support would be crucial in allowing me to focus on my education without the constant worry of financial constraints.
