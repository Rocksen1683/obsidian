*Layering*, in the context of [[ECE358 - Networks]] helps in designing complex networks. Each *layer* makes the network more modularized and makes it easier to maintain, 

## Internet's Protocol Layers
- *application*: supports network applications like HTTP, IMAP, SMTP, DNS. The data unit at the application layer is called a *message*
- *transport*: process-process data transfer like TCP, UDP. A transport-layer data unit is called a *segment*
- *network*: routing of data from source to destination like IP or routing protocols
- *link*: data transfer between neighbouring network elements. A link-layer data unit is called a *frame*.
- *physical*: the actual bits that are getting transmitted through wires
