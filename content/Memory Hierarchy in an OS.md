A *memory hierarchy* is employed in an OS to ensure that we have an optimized trade-off between *fast* access time with a *big* capacity while still having a *low* cost. 

In an OS, we use multiple memory systems to achieve the above and will hence have a hierarchy. The hierarchy works like this, the further you go down: 
- *Decreasing* cost per bit 
- *Increasing* capacity
- *Increasing* access time
- *Decreasing* frequency of access
