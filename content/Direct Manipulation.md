Make the interaction feel like manipulating a "real object" instead of working through an intermediary 

Uses *task objects* which are objects that the user can manipulate

### Describing Instruments 
Three Properties 
- ***Degree of Indirection:*** Spatial/temporal offset between instrument and action on object 
	- Spatial: *near:* drag to translate, *medium:* scrollbar near page, *far:* dialog box 
	- Temporal: *short:* direct drag response, *medium:* activate tool in toolbar, *long:* using dialog, full drag and drop operation 
- ***Degree of Integration:*** Ratio of the *degrees of freedom* of the instrument over the DOF captured by the input device 
	- Captures the suitability of the device
- ***Degree of Compatibility:*** Similarity of physical actions on instrument and response of the object 
	- more similar is better since itâ€™s more natural or intuitive
