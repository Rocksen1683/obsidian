*Slicing:* A program slice consists of all statements, including conditions in the program, that might affect the value of variable $V$ and point $P$

#### [[Backward Slicing]]
#### [[Forward Slicing]]
#### [[Dynamic Slicing]]

#### Slicing Precision 
- *soundness:*  must never delete a statement from the original program which could have an effect upon the slicing criterion
- *completeness:* slicing algorithm must remove all statements which cannot effect the slicing criterion
