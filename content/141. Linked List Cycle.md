## Problem 
https://leetcode.com/problems/linked-list-cycle/

## Approach 
- Have two pointers `slow` and `fast`
- Move them at different speeds 
- If at some point, fast reaches slow then -> cycle

## Solution 
``` python 
def hasCycle(self, head: Optional[ListNode]) -> bool:
	#two pointers, fast and slow
	dummy = ListNode(0)
	dummy.next = head
	slow = dummy
	fast = head

#make the fast pointer move faster than slow and if it meets slow again that means cycle
	while fast and fast.next:
		if slow == fast:
			return True
		slow = slow.next
		fast = fast.next.next
		
	return False
```
