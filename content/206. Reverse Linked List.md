## Problem 
https://leetcode.com/problems/reverse-linked-list/description/

## Approach 

- Have a current node set to head 
- Have a prev node set to none 
- Iterate until current is None 
- Use temp val to store next node
- Set current's next to prev
- Increment both current and prev 
- Return prev 

## Solution 

```python 
prev = None
curr = head

while curr:
	#using a temp node to store next val
    temp = curr.next
    #setting the next value to prev node -> reverse
    curr.next = prev
    #moving prev forward -> increment
    prev = curr
    #move curr to temp val -> increment
    curr = temp
    
return prev
```
