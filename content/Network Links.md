- *Transmitter* transforms the message into a signal suitable for transmission over the physical medium

### Phenomenon that limit the transmission of bits 
- Attenuation 
- Distortion
- Dispension
- Noise

### Physical Media 
A *physical link* is what lies between transmitter and receiver 

- *Guided Media*: Signals that propagate in solid media: copper, fiber, etc 
- *Unguided Media*: signals propagate freely, e.g radio

Some **important** characteristics of a transmission system:
1. [[Propagation Delay]]: Time required for signal to travel across media
2. [[Bandwidth]]: Maximum times per second that the signal can change (in Hertz)
3. *Rate*: Number of bits that can be transmitted on the link un a given unit of time (i.e, bits/s)
4. [[Bit Error Rate]] 

Different physical media:
- [[Twisted Pair]]
- [[Coaxial Cable]]
- [[Fiber Optic Cable]]
- [[Wireless]]
