There are 3 main types of concurrent systems:
1. **Discovering Implicit Concurrency:** Attempting to find concurrency in a sequential program by doing things like parallelizing loops and data structures 
2. **Providing Implicit Concurrency:** Using implicit constructs, the programmer can provide concurrency indirectly using constructs like `pragma` or a parallelized `for` loop
3. **Providing Explicit Concurrency:** Programmer provides concurrency by explicitly managing threads
