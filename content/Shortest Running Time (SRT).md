The *shortest running time* policy is a *preemptive* version of [[Shortest Process Next (SPN)]] and basically preemptively runs the process with the shortest running time ($s - e$). 

This policy is pretty good as it does not have the bias towards long processes and I/O processes like [[First Come First Served (FCFS)]] and also no additional overhead for interrupts like [[Round Robin Scheduling]].
