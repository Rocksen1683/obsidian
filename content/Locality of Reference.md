*Locality of Reference*, also known as the *Principle of Locality* refers to the tendency of a processor to access the same set of memory locations repetitively over a short period of time
### Types of Locality 
- **Temporal Locality** - Memory location that is referenced once will be referenced again multiple times in the near future
- **Spatial Locality** - memory location is referenced once, then the program is likely to reference a nearby memory location in the near future
