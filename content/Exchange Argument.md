In words you would use *exchange argument* like this 
- Assume that there is an optimal solution $L$ that boasts some *ordering* of elements
- By contradiction, prove that that ordering is actually *wrong*
- Calculate the value of the solution using the "optimal" ordering 
- Consider another ordering $L'$ such that $L'$ swaps the ordering in $L$
- Show that $L'$ is better, proving that ordering of $L$ was not *optimal*.
